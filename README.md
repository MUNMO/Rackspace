What I covered in this application:
1. This application is developed using React& Redux.
2. It supports ESLint.
3. It supports editor configuration.
4. Basic testing configuration is done.
5. The changes will be watching and automatically refreshed in the browser
6. One command "npm start" enough to run the application. It will parallelly check the ESLint and Test case running.

Let me know if you have any queries in running the application.
